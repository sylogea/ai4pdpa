\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

We are grateful to all who supported the AI4PDPA project throughout Term 7.

From AsiaCloud Solutions, we extend our appreciation to Mr Ng Lye Kiat for his trust, openness, and flexibility, which allowed the team meaningful autonomy in architectural and budgeting decisions. His support created the space needed for thoughtful exploration and well-grounded technical planning. We also thank Mr Yuri See, whose role as our primary point of contact and subject matter expert provided consistent clarity. His insights into practical compliance work, clear expectations, and steady encouragement were instrumental throughout the term. Our gratitude further goes to Ms Valerie Ng, whose reliable presence during meetings and dedicated support behind the scenes ensured smooth collaboration and operational continuity.

From the Singapore University of Technology and Design, we express our sincere appreciation to Dr Sun Zhu for her steady guidance, clarity, and structured feedback. Her advice helped us avoid premature implementation and focus instead on planning, exploration, and rigorous architectural grounding. Her mentorship played a central role in shaping AI4PDPA into a coherent and feasible project. We also thank Dr Thomas Schroepfer for his constructive feedback during reviews and presentations. His external perspective strengthened our problem framing, design justification, and communication. Finally, we acknowledge Dr Susan Wong, whose support from the Centre for Writing and Rhetoric enhanced the quality of our written deliverables. Her guidance on structure, clarity, and professional expression helped refine our team’s communication throughout the term.

The team is deeply grateful to all who contributed their time, expertise, and guidance in helping AI4PDPA progress meaningfully during Term 7.
